### Climate-Clustering - Clustering Autoencoder for AI-generated climate patterns
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)](./LICENSE)

Climate-clustering is a new data-driven climate classification workflow based on an unsupervised deep learning technique that can accommodate the vast volume of spatiotemporal numerical climate projection data. We aim to identify climate patterns and distinct zones that capture multiple climate variables as well as their future changes under different climate change scenarios. 
The project was also supported by [Frontier Development Lab 2022](https://frontierdevelopmentlab.org/fdl-2022#adaptation)
